                <li>Sponsors or partners only where required for event logistics (with your consent where applicable).
                </li>
                <li>Legal &amp; safety reasons: when required by law, to respond to legal requests, to protect rights,

            </ul>
            <p>We do not sell personal information. If any sale of business or assets occurs, personal information may

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Third-Party Services &amp; Links</h2>
            <p>The Site may include links to third-party websites and embed third-party services (social media, maps,
                ticketing). These services have their own privacy practices — we encourage you to read their policies
                before providing personal information.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain personal information as long as necessary to provide services, comply with legal obligations,
                resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Retention periods vary depending on the nature of the data
                and the purposes for which it was collected.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
            <p>Your data may be stored or processed outside your country. When we transfer data across borders, we take
                steps to protect it in accordance with applicable law (e.g., standard contractual clauses or other
                safeguards where required).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>10. Security</h2>
            <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures aimed at protecting personal data. However,
                no system is completely secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security. If a data breach occurs that
                affects you, we will notify you and authorities as required by law.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
